Create procedural animation 
The goal is to create some type of procedural animation that i can dynamicaly change with limbs and other features that i desire 
learn how to structure code before executing it 


*Features*: 
- follow the mouse
- be able to change to diffretent types of animals like snakes, fishes, dogs
- legs 
- different semgnet size 


*structure*
# spine class # 
- the structure of the animal 
- be able to change size of the spine segments 
- handles restriction of the animal such as distance, angle ([text](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/))


# animal class # // like snake dog or fish 
- handles the movement of the animal 
- holds the features of the animal such as spine and legs
- 

# util #
- handles vector calculations 
- calculates the constrains
